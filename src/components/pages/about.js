        My name is Andrea. I am currently a student, learning to be a Full Stack
        Developer. This has been an amazing journey so far and I cannot wait to
        see where this will take me. The most important thing I have learned so
        far is that perseverance while learning these new skills has been
        challenging and yet truly rewarding. I have big goals set for myself and
        I have been checking them off one by one. Maybe in the future I could be
        a good fit for your team?
